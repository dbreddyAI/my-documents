    "4. seperate the pressure into 3 sections: **Vaccum stage, Elevate stage, Decay stage**. We perform 2 minutes of vaccum for sample chamber(Vaccum stage), then raise the pressure in reference cell by connecting to He tank(elevate stage),  setting up the max vaccum pressure P_vacc_max, any pressure that is smaller than that is the vaccum pressure id_vac = P_raw < P_vac_max (e.g.P_vac_max =0.5); then get the average vaccum pressure P_vac_mean. The get the elevate stage, where set the upper boundary and lower boundary of the pressure. first get the total max pressure, then perform  e.g. max - p < 0.033* max to find out the pressure P_elevated; In the decay stage, as it usually takes about over 24 hours to do the measurement, the pressure needed to be corrected for leakage (not for elevated stage or vaccum stage!). as the gas leakage cannot be avoi. The finally decay pressure is not a horizontal line,instead it is a inclined line. choosing a point in the late time where you think that the leakage dominates the decay, use that to do a linear fit to get the slope k from this equation p_decay = k*t + b. then the actual decay pressure P_decay_corr = P_decay ; you can plot the histogram of corrected finally pressure to see if it is gaussian distribution. then get the finally corrected decay using the finally 18 points P_decay_final_mean.\n",
