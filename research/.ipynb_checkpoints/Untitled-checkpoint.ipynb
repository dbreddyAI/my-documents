    "    - Spin polarization: the degree by which the spin of elementary particles is **aligned to a given direction**.\n",
    "    - Spin: intrinsic angular momentum of elementary particles. Both protons and neutrons are spin =1/2. The total argular momentum of odd number of protons is non-zero [intro1](#intro1).<br>  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Angular momentum L: Anology to linear momentum $p = mv$, angular momentum is proportional to moment of inertia I and angular speed $\\omega$.  $$L = I \\omega $$ $$\\omega = 2\\pi f$$ It depends on the mass, position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Torque: rotational force. When you apply force to a object, the object tend to rotate along a axis. Torque equals to distance cross product of Force $$\\tau = r \\times F = |r||F|\\sin\\theta$$\n",

    "    - Moment of inertia: angular mass or rotational inertia. it determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration\n",

    "   - Why hydorgen, NMR measurement can be made on any nucleus that has an odd number of protons. hydrogen is abundant in both water and hydrocarbons. has a relatively large magnetic moment can could be detected by intruments. \n",
    "   - spin or angular momentum[intro1](#intro1). Angular momentum is a vector which can be described by **a magnitude L** and **a direction, m**. The magnitude $$L = \\hbar \\sqrt{(I(I+1))} $$ where I is the spin quantum number, or Nuclear Spin Angular Momentum, m is the direction. $$m = -I, -I+1, ...,+I$$ for hydrogen $I = n/2$ and $n = 1$, n is the principal quantum number \n",
    "   - angular momentum along z direction[intro1](#intro1). $$I_z=\\hbar m$$ This is only for one proton. system angular momentum will be a cumulative effects.  \n",
